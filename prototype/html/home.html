        Pets are nature's gift to humanity. It has been scientifically proven that
        opening our homes and hearts to a pet increases our longevity and improves our
        overall quality of life as well as the lives of our pets. At Pet Paradigm
        Professionals, our mission is to offer resources to help you care for your
        furry, scaly, feathery, and slimy loved ones. Our pet experts—or “Pexperts”—have
