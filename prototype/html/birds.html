      <h1>Relational Needs for Birds</h1>

      <p>
        Birds are very intriguing creatures as they can range from birds as small as
        a Cuban bee hummingbird (about two inches long and a little over 1/20 of an
        ounce) to as large as an ostrich. While most birds fly, there are some that
        don't. Birds are amazing and each breed is unique in its own way, particularly
        when it comes to their relational needs and well-being. Unfortunately, birds
        can experience sadness and depression just like humans. A number of root
        causes may be responsible for your bird's depression such as an illness
        (either physical or mental), losing its companion, or increasingly becoming
        bored.

      <p>
        Some signs to help identify if your bird is experiencing depression may
        include the following:

      <ul>
        <li>reduced appetite</li>
        <li>becoming increasingly irritable</li>
        <li>aggressive behavior</li>
        <li>songs have a different, more solemn tone</li>
      </ul>

      </p>

      <p>
        Be sure to tell your veterinarian if you see signs of any of these symptoms.
        Just like many illnesses, identifying and treating the symptoms earlier may
        drastically increase the lifespan of your birdie.
